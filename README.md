This is basic project of core Django.In this project I have made some templates and static files. Added CSS in it. Used some bootstrap components.
This project is of adding tasks in frontend and its automatically saved to database and automatically showing in tasks section.
At home page we were able to add tasks and save it to database, using Django as backend and frontend both in the same project.
